# Hue Controller For Glass
Google Glass app to control Hue lights.
This project was created in the last half of 2014.  After many atempts to get it onto the Glass App
Store, I took a break due to thier strict requirements.  The Glass Explorer project then ended in
January of 2015, and I have not pursued further development.

No need to pull out your phone!  Use Glass to control your Hue lights with a simple tap by turning
them on, off, or randomizing the color and brightness (More features to come in future updates).
All you need is a Philips Hue bridge connected to your wireless network, and a Hue light.

Installation:
In order to install the app, you must sideload the apk to a Google Glass.
