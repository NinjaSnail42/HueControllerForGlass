# Hue Controller For Glass
Google Glass app to control Hue lights.

This project was created in the last half of 2014.  After many atempts to get it onto the Glass App Store, I took a break due to thier strict requirements.  The Glass Explorer project then ended in January of 2015, and I have not pursued further development.

Installation:
In order to install the app, you must sideload the apk to a Google Glass.
